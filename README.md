For practicing git using python

YoungJin.com gave me a book '파이썬 코드로 배우는 Git, Git Hub'. It is very inersting topic that Git is one of the most important tool and python is another popular development language thesedays. No more explanation might not be necessary why I should read this book.

I'll make a progress everyday even it's small.
Hope to read all contents within a month.
